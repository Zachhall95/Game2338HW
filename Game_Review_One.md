## Summary

Pokémon Sword and Shield is a turned based role-playing game released by Game Freak in November of 2019. Pokémon is a long established franchised well known for its gameplay of exploring the game world, capturing monsters found throughout your journey, and using your captured monsters in battles with other trainers. Like all previous Pokemon generations, Sword and Shield takes place in its own unique world known as the Galar region. Along with the Galar region comes a new story, new characters, and new pokemon to capture. 

Sword and Shield naturally features the base combat that Pokemon fans have known and loved throughout the franchise. Each player battles pokemon with various attacks, types, and stats. While considering type advantages and the pokemon’s strengths and weaknesses, the player must form various strategies to achieve victory. Sword and Shield features the same battle system; however, it does introduce a completely new mechanic known as dynamax. This was introduced for the purpose of shaking up the Pokemon battle formula by adding a new dimension to battle by way of dramatically turning the tides with one ability. Dynamaxing is only available once per battle allowing one of your pokemon to become massive and capable of inflicting an immense amount of damage to the opponent. Outside of battles, the creators of Sword and Shield have also changed the process of finding and capturing pokemon.

In every pokemon game before Sword and Shield was released, searching for pokemon was consistent throughout the series. To find pokemon, the player needed to run through tall grass until a pokemon encounter is triggered. This method did not allow the player to know where pokemon are or what pokemon is in the grass until after the battle has started. In Sword and Shield the method to find pokemon have been changed slightly. Now pokemon can be seen running around the world before engaging the pokemon in a battle. This allows the player to know what pokemon they will be fighting. This slight change lets the player determine whether they wish to engage that pokemon in a battle or avoid the encounter completely.


## Final Thoughts

Pokemon Sword and Shield does attempt at mixing up the Pokemon formula to create variety between the generations of games, however, fails in aspects of the franchise that previous generation did very well. Compared to the previous generations, the story of Sword and Shield is lacking both in its characters and sense of stakes. In Sword and Shield, there is no real villain. Chairman Rose officially is the antagonist of the game, but he is not a motivating force for the protagonist. The only thing chairman rose does is appear at the end of the game to be the boss of the campaign. Having such a weak antagonist simply makes the game’s narrative uninteresting. Pokemon Sword and Shield is a fun game that positively changes how a Pokemon game is played. However, compared to aspects that are done well in previous Pokemon games, such as the narrative, Sword and Shield falls short.
