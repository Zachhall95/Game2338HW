## Summary

Destiny 2 is a first-person multiplayer looter shooter developed by Bungie and released to pc and consoles on September 6, 2017. Your character is a guardian, a being granted the power of light by a celestial orb known as the traveler. When the traveler came to earth, it brought with it many technological advances, but it was followed. An entity referred to as the darkness, the enemy of the traveler, attacked leaving the traveler crippled and humanity on the brink of extinction. Your job, as a guardian, is to fight back the forces of darkness throughout the solar system to insure the survival of humanity. 

Destiny 2 is a huge game that offers players the potential to play how they want. There are three classes, Titan, Hunter, and Warlock, each with three subclasses and each subclass has three skill trees to pick. Recently, a fourth subclass was added to Destiny 2 offering even more variety for players. In addition to the classes, the game has armor stats, armor mods, weapon mods, and 17 different weapon types with over 600 weapons in total. With such a massive amount of variety, anybody can build a unique and powerful loadout that fits their play style. 

Beyond the abilities and weapons of the player’s guardian, Destiny 2 also features a large amount of activities. Destiny 2’s activities can be divided into two categories, Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Environment (PvE). Each category has encounters and rewards for both casual players and hardcore endgame players alike. For example, the crucible and gambit are PvP activities available to every player at any level and provide rewards that increase the player’s level. Trials of Osiris is a PvP activity that only the best of crucible players will succeed in and gain its unique rewards. The same is true for PvE activities as well. The vanguard strikes playlist is an activity for casual or lower leveled players, while the grandmaster strike and raid are meant to offer a challenge to the highest leveled players. With such a wide range of activities to pursue and new ones added with every season, Destiny 2 keeps growing and developing with new activities to keep player engaged.


## Final Thoughts

Destiny 2 is a very entertaining game that lends itself to the broadest audience possible. It has been through several iteration throughout the years, but it has always made the players feel unique and offer an extensive amount of activities and rewards to pursue. Through Bungie’s seasons model, new weapons, armor, and activities are released at a more frequent rate then the times when only content updates the game received were during the release of dlc. This keeps the game feeling fresh and gives the players even more activities to play. With the shear amount of content in the game, with more always on the way, there is something for everyone to enjoy in Destiny 2.
