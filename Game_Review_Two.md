## Summary

  Hades, released on September 17, 2020 and developed by Supergiant Games, is an isometric rogue-like dungeon crawler that challenges the player to escape hell. The protagonist of Hades is Zagreus, the son of Hades and the prince of the underworld. Zagreus has decided to leave the underworld against the wishes of his father but leaving is not as simple as it sounds. Against the deadly forces of the underworld hellbent on stopping him, Zagreus will have to dodge, shoot, and slash his way through a beautifully designed world to obtain his freedom.

  Like many rogue-like games dying in the game sends the player back to the beginning but dying in Hades works differently. In most games, death is a non-canonical event that occurs when the player fails. The scenario resets and the player tries again until the desired or canonical outcome is achieved. However, in Hades, Zagreus’ death happens within the universe of the game. Friendly and enemy NPCs all remember Zagreus’ previous escape attempts and will reference his effort through dialogue. Beyond that, the player can upgrade abilities using currency collected on previous runs and follow storylines of different characters that can reward perks during a fight. This keeps the since of progression intact and removes the dreadful since of dying because the player is always growing stronger and developing the story.

  The combat of Hades is a thrill to play and the build potential will keep players hooked for hours. When first starting Hades, the player must make a choice between six different weapons that all work differently from one another and those weapon’s abilities can be modified in four different ways. On top of that, Zagreus can collect a variety of boons and keepsakes that all have different effects. At first the combat will be rather methodical, but as you progress combat becomes wildly entertaining with the game’s various builds.


## Final Thoughts

  Hades is an amazing game with every one of its aspects making me want to come back and play more. Starting with the narrative of the game, a coming of age story of the son of Hades and his struggle to escape the underworld is an excellent premise. The compelling friends and enemies encountered along the way all have distinct personalities and makes the game very charming. The beautiful art style, character design, and level design enhance the experience of the game. The in-depth combat system that improves customization and replayability. All these things make Hades one of the best games of the year.
