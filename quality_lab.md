## Game 1: Super Mario Bros

Correctness: Super Mario Bros goal is to be a game that provides entertainment to its players. Super Mario Bros accomplishes this goal very well through its art style, various enemies, sound design, and level design.

Reliablility: Super Mario Bros controls are very responsive and perform the desired action consistantly. The hit boxes closely aline with the sprites to avoid the feeling of being hit when it appeared as if you dodged an attack.
